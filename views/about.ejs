                            Since my childhood, I've been passionate about football. I grew up following multiple leagues and discovering new players every week. For me, football is more than a sport: it's a celebration, a universal language that brings people together. This site was born from this passion, as a way to share this joy and offer a tool for everyone who loves to compare and analyze players.

                            Marcelo Bielsa, for his demanding nature, his almost obsessive methodological knowledge of the game, and his vision of football in society. Also Didier Roustan, for his unique way of narrating the game with poetry and depth. Their approach reinforced my belief that football must remain a means of bringing people together, a spectacle, a moment of escape from daily life where everyone is equal.

                            Here, numbers serve the passion. Stat4Ballers allows you to compare players, but the idea isn't just to produce statistics: it's to give enthusiasts and professionals a simple, fun, and inspiring tool to fuel debates and celebrate the beauty of the game.
